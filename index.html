        <h3>A Little about Me</h3>
        <p>To learn about me, I'll start with the fact that I have grown up in Canada and have many different hobbies including: drawing, playing guitar, writing, reading and more recently crochet. I have 2 bestfriends and an older brother. I also have the cutest cat in the world who is really old.</p>
        
        <h3>Future Plans</h3>
        <p>I want to become a video game developer, who works in a team and creates games focusing on either animals or survival. I also at some point want to live in Europe, I'm not sure where yet, but I really love the look of the UK. I mean the sites are beautiful, just look at this picture of Scotland.</p>
